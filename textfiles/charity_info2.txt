It is located at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. USNATO represents U.S. foreign policy interests within the Alliance. The mission is a diverse team of individuals representing numerous U.S. federal agencies. U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO occupies the U.S. chair in the North Atlantic Council (NAC), which is the principal political decision-making body within NATO. The NAC oversees the political and military process relating to security issues affecting the Alliance.  The NAC brings together representatives of each member country to discuss policy or operational questions, providing a forum for wide-ranging consultation between members on all issues affecting their peace and security.              Key Officers  Ambassador Julianne Smith Deputy Chief of Mission Richard “Rick” Holtzapple SECDEFREPEUR and Defense Advisor Rachel Ellehuus D/SECDEFREPEUR and Deputy Defense Advisor David F. Helvey Public Affairs Advisor Kathy Giles-Diaz Management Advisor Maureen Higgins           Official Residence Official Residence Truman Hall is a traditional Flemish country estate built in 1963 for Côte d’Or chocolatier Jean Michiels. The house is the residence of the Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is named in honor of President Harry S Truman, one of NATO’s founders. The design is the successful collaboration between Architect B.A. Jacquemotte and Landscape Architect René Pechère. Pechère, one of the best-known contemporary landscape architects in Europe, transformed 27 acres of barren agricultural land into gentle hills and valleys, meadows, and formal gardens. A curvaceous cobbled drive, lined with roses, leads to the tree-lined approach to the residence. The home overlooks a sweeping lawn, towering cedars, English gardens and an herb garden. The lawn pavilion is planted with fragrant honeysuckles, roses, clematis, hydrangeas and wisteria. The original children’s playground, giant sequoia circle and maze are still effective landscape elements. Discrete paths wind through sequestered corners for quiet reflection. In 1984 on the anniversary celebrating Truman Hall becoming NATO’s official residence, a new garden was created with cobbled circles representing each NATO country. The Truman Hall residence is constructed of painted brick, grey stone, and has slate roof dormers. Virginia creeper relieves the grey and white stucco, and in the Fall, turns a festive red orange. The plan is designed to capture sunlight – the kitchen/breakfast rooms face east, the dining room is illuminated at lunchtime; and the salons overlook sunsets. The interiors are humanly scaled with sensible arrangements and elegant proportions. The entry hall is paved in the famous “pierre bleu” Belgian black marble. The corridors are wide and inviting, and there is a library with fine 18th century wood paneling. Truman Hall, graciously welcoming visitors from the 29 NATO nations and Alliance partner countries around the world, was sold to the U.S. Government at a reduced price by Mrs. Michiels, who said: “I want you to have it. Your country saved mine in World War II.”          Grants Program The Office of the Public Affairs Advisor manages the U.S. Mission to NATO’s grants program, which is designed to assist non-government organizations and think-tanks that focus on international affairs, defense and security issues, and U.S. and European relations to create programs that encourage public discussions and creative public engagements in Europe that advance U.S. policies regarding NATO.

Art in Embassies Program Established in 1963, the U.S. Department of State’s office of Art in Embassies (AIE) plays a vital role in our nation’s public diplomacy through a culturally expansive mission, creating temporary and permanent exhibitions, artist programming, and publications. AIE curates exhibitions for the representational spaces of all U.S. chanceries, consulates, and embassy residences worldwide, selecting and commissioning contemporary art from the U.S. and the host countries. These exhibitions provide international audiences with a sense of the quality, scope, and diversity of both countries’ art and culture, establishing AIE’s presence in more countries than any other U.S. foundation or arts organization. The NATO permanent collection, curated by the U.S. Department of State’s Office of Art in Embassies, is an installation of artworks that honors the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces.

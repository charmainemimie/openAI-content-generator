The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) is offering grants through its Rocky Mountain Rangelands Program to support voluntary conservation, restoration, and improvement of habitat in the Intermountain West. The program has four priorities: management/local eradication of invasive annual grasses in Idaho; mesic area/wet meadow, sagebrush restoration and strategic conifer removal on Bureau of Land Management lands; projects that promote innovations in grazing management; and removing or modifying fence or other anthropogenic obstructions. Grants will be awarded for approximately $2.5 million with major private funding from Cargill, Taco Bell, Capri, and Altria, and federal funding from The Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Natural Resources Conservation Services. Projects must be within the polygon below and preference will be given to projects within the Owyhee/Great Basin, High Divide, Green/Bear, and Western Slope focal areas. Preference will also be given to projects that accelerate adoption of cost effective and sustainable approaches with a high likelihood of success. NFWF encourages projects that incorporate outreach to communities, foster community engagement, and pursue collaborative management leading to measurable conservation benefits. 
The Rocky Mountain Rangelands Program has approximately $2.5 million available in funding for the 2023 Request for Proposals (RFP). NFWF anticipates awarding between 6-8 grants with a suggested minimum requested amount of $100,000. Eligible applicants include non-profit 501(c) organizations, U.S. Federal government agencies, state government agencies, local governments, municipal governments, Tribal governments, and educational institutions. The program focuses on improving migrations and corridors by removing derelict fencing, installing exclusionary fencing for wildlife crossings, and protecting acres under long-term easement. It also provides capacity, outreach, and incentives to people with changed behavior, planning, research, and monitoring studies, and habitat conservation. A 1:1 non-federal match is required as in-kind or cash contributions. Projects will be evaluated based on Program Goals and Priorities, Technical Merit, Partnership, Community Impact, Cost-Effectiveness, Transferability, Communication, Funding Need, Conservation Plan and Context, Monitoring, Long-term Sustainability, and Past Success. Applications must be submitted online through National Fish and Wildlife Foundationâ€™s Easygrants system by August 3rd, 2023. Awards will be announced in mid-November 2023.
